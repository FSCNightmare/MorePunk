Setting: (CyberPunk, Dystopian)
     - The Polaksian Galaxy; a galaxy located more than 5 trillion light years away from Sector 14, an area of space no longer
        occupied by anything that would be even remotely considered human.
Back story:
       - A large asteroid that goes by the title of "Messenger Planet":
          - This "planet" is headed by the CEO of the messenger company, "InfraCorps"
               - This single company lives on the planet and takes contracts from large corporations, political leaders, and wealthy
                 nations located throughout the Polaksian Galaxy
               - The CEO goes by the title "Cardinal" as he believes to be as powerful as the Chairman of the largest multi trillion dollar corporation,
                 "<insert name here>".
     - Many companies around the world are no longer in operation, most major companies and business have been sucked up into
       <insert name here>
     - Many governments have partnered with smaller (still multi million dollar) companies:
          - These people believe that the time of prosperity (21st century) was the most ideal time, for people and businesses alike. They go by the 
            moniker "The Faithful".
          - Rumors have begun to spread about a "Pendant" called the Pendant of Chalism that if returned to its rightful home could return the 
            universe to glory. (Sector 14)
     - These "Faithful" know that they are being chased by <insert name here> and that the only way to be truly free of their grasp is to make
        it to this "Sector 14". 
     - Sector 14:
          - This area was once the most populated area in all of the known Universe, there were 9 planets, 9 symbols of life, and on 
             each planet, there was a pendant much like the Pendant of Chalisam, and for the most part these pendants have been 
             lost to time and history.
          - The "Faithful" believe if they can return all of the pendants to their rightful home then Sector 14 will be restored and
             once again flourish, and the universe will no longer be restricted by the tyrannical <insert name here>.
Protagonist:
          - Chase is a messenger for the Cardinal, but not just any messenger, he's the best of the best.
          - Chase had been, before becoming a messenger, one of the Cardinal's high guard, essentially the equivalent of a 21st Century Navy Seal, 
            he was trained and deadly.
          - He always makes the delivery on time and never looses the package no matter what the situation or the contents of the package. This is 
            due mainly to his skill as a trained killer, being a messenger is a dangerous job.
Story:
          - Chase gets a phone call from work while at home and is given his next delivery. This one is just like all the rest, except         
            the location - Planet Fazalkua, a planet within 4 hours of the dreaded Sector 14.
          - He begins a normal delivery, pick up the package, get the signature from the sender, then begin the delivery.
          - He makes it just a little bit past His home world of Zarloas before he has to take a "pitstop", he is already about a week 
            ahead of schedule and figures he could use a break; he just worked 4 deliveries back to back.
          - He decides to stop at the nearest gas station, fuel up, eat, then leave.
          - While he's fueling up his cruiser he notices a few men in a business-like attire watching him from inside the diner.
          - Chase always keeps a pistol behind the dash and a shotgun on the inside of the driver door, so he figures that if 
            something were to happen he could just flash his messenger badge and not have to worry about the guns. He didn't feel 
            like killing anyone today.
